✅ Key Insights

**1. Workforce Size & Structure**

Headcount: 157 employees

Terminated employees: 43, resulting in an Attrition Rate of 22%, which is relatively high for most industries.

Average Employee Age: 38 years

Average Experience: 7.3 years

Insight: The workforce is mature and experienced, which may contribute to stability but could also lead to higher salary costs.

**2. Department Distribution**

Highest headcount: Finance (39), followed by HR (34) and IT (32).

Lowest: Marketing (25) and Sales (27).

Insight: Resource distribution is uneven across departments. Areas like Marketing may be understaffed compared to business needs.

**3. Gender Diversity**

Male: 56%

Female: 44%

Insight: Diversity is fairly balanced, but opportunities remain to further close the gap, especially in technical departments.

**4. Age Group Analysis**

Largest groups:

25–34 (50 employees)

35–44 (45 employees)

45–54 (42 employees)

Very few employees aged 55+ (6 employees).

Insight: Succession planning is needed because senior age groups are less represented. This may affect leadership pipelines.

**5. Hires & Leavers Trend**

Hiring has grown significantly and there are peaks in 2013, 2015, 2020 and 2022.

Leavers remain consistently low except for spikes in certain recent years.

Insight: Hiring growth indicates business expansion, but higher termination years signal possible issues with retention, culture, or onboarding effectiveness.
